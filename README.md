# Canine Hero App

## INSPIRATION
One day, I stumbled upon an article online about a dog named, Mica. Mica is a 10-year-old mixed breed pup and had a traumatic start to life, according to the League For Animal Welfare. They say he has learned to be wary of humans he doesn't know, so he has been living in a shelter for over 7 years and is still looking for a home. As a fellow dog lover and owner, this was heartbreaking to read. Every dog deservers a loving home. This story is what inspired Canine Hero.

## WHAT IT DOES

Canine Hero is an online app that helps find loving homes for dogs in shelters. It's a platform where shelters can post dogs that are up for adoption and also where potential owners can go and search for a pet that might be a good fit. Anyone can create an account and start searching right away.

## WHAT'S NEXT

I plan to build out more features of the application so that potential adopters can easily filter through dogs to find a match much easier. After adding these features, I want to promote the platform to shelters, so that as many dogs that are stuck in shelters can go seen by potential owners.
